            Quiz Game in Python

            A "quiz game" is an interactive and educational activity where participants, often referred 
            to as players or contestants, are presented with a series of questions or challenges that test 
            their knowledge on a specific topic or a variety of subjects. The primary goal of a quiz game 
            is to entertain, engage, and educate participants while allowing them to compete or assess their knowledge.
            
            Making Quiz Game is a great practice in learning list, set, dictionary, and tuple.
            Each script material has it's pro and con which will be discussed.
            I will show you each example individually and in combination; 

Definition: 
      Array - 
            In Python, the term "array" is often used to refer to a sequence of elements, usually of the same data type, 
            organized in a linear fashion. While Python does have lists and NumPy arrays that serve similar purposes as 
            traditional arrays in some other programming languages, Python arrays are generally not considered a built-in data type.

            Here's a simplified definition:

            "An array-like structure in Python is a collection of elements, typically of the same data type, arranged in a linear sequence."

      List -
            In Python, a "list" is a built-in data structure used to store an ordered collection of elements or items. 
            Lists are versatile and mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creating them. Each element 
            in a list can be of a different data type, including numbers, strings, other lists, and more. 
            
            Here's a simplified definition:

            "A list in Python is a flexible and ordered collection of items where you can store and manipulate various data types."

      Set -
            In Python, a "set" is a built-in data structure used to store a collection of unique and unordered elements. 
            Sets are like containers that can hold various items, but each item must be distinct (no duplicates), and the 
            items are not stored in any particular order. 

            Here's a simplified definition:

            "A set in Python is a collection of unique elements where each element appears only once, and the order of elements is not guaranteed."

      Dictionary -
            In Python, a "dictionary" is a built-in data structure used to store a collection of key-value pairs. 
            Each key in a dictionary is unique, and it is associated with a corresponding value. Dictionaries are 
            also known as "maps" or "hash maps" in other programming languages. 

            Here's a simplified definition:

            "A dictionary in Python is like a real-world dictionary. It stores pairs of words (keys) and their meanings (values). 
            You can look up the meaning (value) of a word (key) quickly."

      Tuple - 
            In Python, a "tuple" is a built-in data structure used to store an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list. 
            However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, which means once you create a tuple, you cannot change its contents 
            (add, remove, or modify elements). Tuples are created using parentheses () or the tuple() constructor.

            Here's a simplified definition:
            
            "A tuple in Python is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list, but with the key difference that it cannot be changed after it is created."

      NumPy -
            NumPy, which stands for "Numerical Python," is a popular open-source library in Python used for numerical and 
            scientific computing. It provides support for multidimensional arrays (often referred to as NumPy arrays or ndarrays) 
            and a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is a fundamental library for 
            data manipulation, data analysis, and numerical computations in Python.

            Here's a simplified definition of NumPy:

            "NumPy is a Python library that provides support for efficient manipulation and computation with multidimensional arrays 
            and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to perform operations on these arrays."
